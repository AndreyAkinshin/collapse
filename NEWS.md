# collapse 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* First version of the package, based on code by Sebastian Martin Krantz
  shared on R-devel.
* Major rework of the package using Rcpp, and expansion of scope of package to a broad     set of data transformation and exploration tasks. This rework was done largely without   git.
