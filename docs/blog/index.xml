collapse was released on CRAN end of March. The current version 1.2.1 performs well on all operating systems, passing &amp;gt; 5600 unit tests covering all core functionality, thus a good point to start introducing the package to a larger audience. collapse has 2 main aims:
1. To facilitate complex data transformation and exploration tasks in R.
(In particular grouped and weighted statistical computations, advanced aggregation of multi-type data, advanced transformations of time-series and panel-data, and the manipulation of lists)
2. To help make R code fast, flexible, parsimonious and programmer friendly.
(Provide order of magnitude performance improvements via extensive use of C++ and highly optimized R code, broad object orientation, and infrastructure for grouped programming)
