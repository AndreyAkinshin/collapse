# collap R package

The creation of `collap` was inspired by the STATA command `collapse`,
but `collap` is not simply a reproduction of `collapse` for R.
It offers a more advanced, flexible and faster aggregation function
for working with multi-level (panel) data structures. Next to that,
the function `qsu` (shorthand for quick summary) provides a 
way of calculating arbitrary summary statistics.


## Installation

The package can be installed in R using the following code:

remotes::install_github("SebKrantz/collap")

## Warning

The package is currently in development. No warranties whatsoever.
