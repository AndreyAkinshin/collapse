# collapse R package

The creation of the `collapse` package was inspired by the STATA command `collapse`,
but its main function `collap` is more than simply a reproduction of `collapse` for R.
It offers a more advanced, flexible and faster aggregation function
for working with multi-level (panel) data structures and multi-type data. Next to that,
the function `qsu` (shorthand for quick summary) provides a 
way of calculating arbitrary summary statistics for cross-sectional and multi-level (panel) data.


## Installation

The package can be installed in R using the following code:

remotes::install_github("SebKrantz/collapse")

## Warning

The package is currently in development. No warranties whatsoever.
